title: "What is Computer Science?"
---

If you google 'What is Computer Science?', probably you will find out
several posts describing Computer Science (CS) in terms of computers
and programs. However it is not entirely true. In fact, CS is a bad
name for this knowledge area, since it put so much attention on
computers and put other concepts much more important aside, such as
abstractions.

[Edsger Dijsktra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra)
once said 'Computers are for CS as telescopes are for astronomy'. So
computers are just tools to apply computer science.



*Abstraction Science* is a better name and would avoid
that people make wrong assumptions about this subject.
