title: "What is Computer Science?"
---

If you google "What is Computer Science?", probably you will find out several
posts describing Computer Science (CS) in terms of computers and programs.
However it is not entirely true. In fact, CS is a bad name for this knowledge
area, since it put so much attention on computers and let other important
concepts aside. [Edsger
Dijsktra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) once saids "Computers
are for CS as telescopes are for astronomy". In this text I will define CS in
terms of more meaningful terms than computers and computation.

# History

Computer science was born when the humans being figured out they needed some way
to do repeated computations of something easily and fast. In 2700~2300 BCE the
Sumerian came up with the abacus, which is an object to speed up how they did
math calculations.  The Sumerian abacus is a pretty obvious _computation
device_, right? However, what would you say about the [mechanical
loom](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-mechanical-loom/)?- If you
have no idea what it is, check this
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6NgMNvK52A) out.

Created in 18th-century by Jean-Charles Jacquard, the mechanical loom is a
machine where its operator uses several punched cards to control the cumbersome
mechanism to interleave the strings into clothes. The punched cards tell to the
machine how and which strings should be interleaved to create patterns on the
clothes. So, we also have some kind of computation here, as this [adorable
grandma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQzpLLhN0fY) confirms to us. The
repeated process of interleaving the strings is automatized through the
_program_ _written_ in the punched card language. This my friends is the essence
of computing.

> Computers are machines guide by programs to do some task.

Another example of unconventional computer is a simple mechanical clock. Yes,
any analogical clock or watch is also a computer.

Using the definition before, let's demonstrate that a clock is a computer as
well.  As we have learned with the mechanical loom, a computer should automatize
something, and this automation should be achieve through a program. Hence, which
is the automation and what is the program into a clock?

The first is easy, a clock computes how time pass. Before the clocks, the people
should look to the sky and measure the position of the stars to know what time
it was. Remember, the Sun is also a star ;-) So, they figured out that the stars
move over the sky and this movement could be measured. Doing this repeatedly the
human being started to understand and measure the time. Ok, but how this history
fits with our definition? After centuries of observation, Christiaan Huygens
invented the first mechanical clock. Based on gears rotations and spiral
springs, Huygens mapped the stars motion into pointers rotations. Well, it
wasn't a directly mapping, he used the rotation physics to measure how long a
gear does a revolution and doing some math it could model seconds to years using
gears. However, using stars is more poetic, so lets pretend that was from stars
to gears. Hence, the Huygens' clock measure mechanically and repeatedly how the
time goes.

Now we have answered what is the clock's computation, we have to answer how it
can be programmed. To be computer, the device must be programmed, and by
programming I mean, pass a list of instructions so the device (computer) can
repeat indefinitely [or not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem).
Whit this new statement our abacus from the beginning of this section doesn't
seem a computer anymore. In fact it isn't, it is a calculator. On the other hand
the mechanical loom is much like a computer as we know today than an abacus. How
would image it?  Back to our clock, the clock programming happens through the
gears and springs.  The number of gears of different sizes, and how they are
combined with springs give to the clock a behavior - measuring time. A clock
master can make clocks to measure from seconds to years just playing around
different gears combinations.

abstraction and language

As we can see, none of these examples are computers but they do computations and
there are Computer Science on these stuff. 

A little of context...
how computer science arose?

# Abstractions and Models

CS inherits from Math the concept of abstraction. Everyone abstraction on
day-by-day, a simple example are letters and numbers.

*Abstraction Science* is a better name and would avoid
that people make wrong assumptions about this subject.
