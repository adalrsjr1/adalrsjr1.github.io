Hello my friend! My name is Adalberto and I'm a computer scientist. My research
is related to self-adaptation of all sort of systems, specially Cyber-Physical
Systems, Cloud Native Applications, and Domain Specific Modeling Languages
Execution Machines. Over the years I've crystallized some CS concepts that I'm
not used to see on the Internet. So, my intention here is to clarify these
abstract these CS concepts so that everyone can understand this sorcery that I'm
part of.  This blog is open-source, thus if you've found any mistake, typo, or
whatever, don't be shy and let me know
[here](https://github.com/adalrsjr1/adalrsjr1.github.io/issues).
