Hi everyone! I'm PhD in Computer Science and my research interest span
on apply self-adaptation over different sort of systems such
Internet-of-Things, Cyber-Physical Systems, Cloud Native Software and
Domain Specific Modeling Languages (DSML) Execution Machines. Along
the years I have worked with runtime-adaptation -- including runtime
optimization, auto-tuning, self-configuration, and self-healing --
applied to kind of systems aforementioned and the development of DSMLs
and their execution machines to control smart-enviroments such
SmartGrids, SmartSpaces, and SmartCities.
