Hello my friend! My name is Adalberto and I'm a computer scientist. My research
is related to self-adaptation of all sort of systems, specially those related to
the Cloud. Over the years I've crystallized some CS concepts that I'm not used
to see on the Internet. So, my intention here is to clarify these abstract CS
concepts that I judge fun and interesting to share. This blog is open-source,
thus if you've found any mistake, typo, or whatever, don't be shy and let me
know [here](https://github.com/adalrsjr1/adalrsjr1.github.io/issues).

You can find more about me at [Google
